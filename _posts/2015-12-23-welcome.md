Thanks for visiting my website!

So far, I have only published _[The Imposter][0]_, but don't worry: there will be more. Check out an overview of The Marker Chronicles over [here][1].
I'll start working on Book 2 in the series during NaNoWriMo this 
November. Hopefully by then, I'll have worked out all the kinks and have
a good outline in place. Book 2 will be called the _[Brander][2]_. It picks up with Chris' and the Marker's stories a few years after _The Imposter_
ended. A new serial killer is on the loose and sets out to frame the 
Marker for his crimes. If everything works out as I have planned, _The Brander_ will be written by this time next year.

If you haven't yet read _The Imposter, _you can purchase a copy on Lulu by clicking on "Buy Now" below.

Thanks for visiting my new site. I hope you enjoy!!
